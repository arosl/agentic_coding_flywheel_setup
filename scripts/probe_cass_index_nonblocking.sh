# CASS initial-indexing non-blocking probe (bead hfdt-gzjai; fix 874a2a30 in
# the onboarding lesson that is now acfs/onboard/lessons/07_flywheel_loop.md).
#
# THE CLIENT REPORT THIS ANSWERS: "cass install performs an initial indexing
# that takes a very long time and interrupts the whole setup run." `cass
# index` has no --bound/--limit/--since/--timeout flag (verified by
# enumerating every option in `cass index --help`), so any bounding has to
# come from the caller, not from cass itself.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT PROVES, LIVE, EVERY TIME IT RUNS (not by re-reading source):
#
#   1. Backgrounding the index (the shape the onboarding lesson now uses:
#      `nohup cass index --full ... & disown`) returns control to the caller
#      in milliseconds, regardless of whether the index itself succeeds,
#      fails, or is still running when the caller moves on.
#
#   2. Killing an in-flight `cass index --full` mid-build leaves cass in a
#      SAFE, TYPED "needs rebuild" state (`cass health --json` reports
#      initialized=true with a normal rebuild-lexical-index recommendation),
#      not a corrupted archive. This is the property that makes bounding
#      safe at all: a timeout (or a `C-c`/`acfs services stop`) that kills a
#      half-built index must leave cass usable, never corrupt. Precedent for
#      bounding an unbounded cass/cm call this way: %10's `timeout 30` on
#      `cm doctor` at 131beac1.
#
# This script does not touch any real cass archive — everything runs against
# an isolated, disposable --data-dir under a scratch directory the caller
# provides, so it is safe to run against a box whose real cass archive is in
# any state (including corrupt; that would only affect the real archive, not
# this probe).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/probe_cass_index_nonblocking.sh <scratch-dir>
#
# Exits 0 and prints PROBE_PASS on success (both properties hold). Exits 1
# and prints PROBE_FAIL with the failing property named otherwise.
