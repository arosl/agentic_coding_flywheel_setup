# Prepare a scoped swarm handoff

`acfs swarm packet --prepare-batch` turns explicit scoped assignments into a
private directory of complete per-agent work packets and a delivery manifest.
It removes the manual packet/manifest assembly between `swarm assign` and
`swarm packet --deliver-batch`. It does not spawn agents or send prompts.

## Select work and prepare in one command

With a scope map and existing herdr agents, preparation can run the installed
scope-aware allocator directly in the target repository:

```bash
acfs swarm packet --prepare-batch ./handoff \
  --scopes-file scopes.json --roles implementation,documentation \
  --repo "$PWD" --workspace w9 \
  --target '1:RedFox:claude:w9:p3' --target '2:BlueLake:codex:w9:p4'
```

This reads `br ready --json`, optionally enriches ranking with `bv --robot-triage`,
selects independent tasks using the existing allocator, fetches the full selected
task briefs, and generates the bundle. It does not implement a second scheduler.
Supply consecutive target slots `1` through `N`, including panes that may end up
idle. The role count must equal `N`. Without `--roles`, the default is the existing
`balanced` role profile; `--profile` can select `codex-heavy`, `review-heavy`, or
`docs-heavy`. Role profiles never change the explicitly selected native agent type
or move a slot to another pane.

Conflicting or unscoped work remains deferred. Only assigned slots produce
packets; `idle_targets` explains unused panes by name and pane ID. When no
independent work is available, the command returns `status: "no_work"` and exit
code `1`, with the full assignment explanation and **no output directory or
sendable manifest**. A prepared nonempty bundle exits `0`; input or preparation
failure exits `2`.

Automatic selection accepts `--ready-file ready.json --triage-file triage.json`
to replay saved queue and ranking inputs. An explicit `{}` triage file disables
ranking enrichment. Add `--beads-file full-beads.json --no-live-context` to avoid
all br, bv, CM and CASS probes. These flags have separate purposes: a saved full
Beads file alone does not disable live ready-queue selection. All relative input
paths resolve from the invocation directory, not the target repository.

The bundle retains exact supplied `scopes.json`, `ready.json` and `triage.json`
bytes (when supplied) as well as the actual allocator report. The preparation
result records their hashes. Saved evidence does not establish current readiness,
capacity or reservations. Review the produced task-to-pane mapping before sending.

## Prepare an existing assignment report

Generate an assignment report from the intended write scopes:

```bash
umask 077
set -o noclobber
acfs swarm assign --roles implementation,documentation \
  --scopes-file scopes.json --json > assignments.json
```

Read the assigned slots and bind each one to an existing native Claude, Codex or
agy agent in one herdr workspace (`herdr agent list` shows their pane IDs). Use
the actual registered Agent Mail identities, not the example names:

```bash
acfs swarm packet --prepare-batch ./handoff \
  --assignments assignments.json --repo "$PWD" --workspace w9 \
  --target '1:RedFox:claude:w9:p3' --target '2:BlueLake:codex:w9:p4'
```

Each target is `SLOT:AGENT_NAME:AGENT_TYPE:PANE_ID`, where the pane ID belongs to
the `--workspace`. Provide exactly one
for every **assigned** slot, excluding idle slots. Argument order does not matter;
a slot is never reassigned to another pane merely because another slot is idle.
Panes, slots and agent identities must be distinct. Scope-aware assignments are
required; inferred paths and overlapping declared write sets are refused.
`--assignments` and `--scopes-file` are mutually exclusive. Role/profile and
ready/triage options cannot silently override an existing assignment report.

By default preparation reads each selected task with `br show ID --json` and
uses the existing packet generator's bounded CM/CASS context lookups. Supply
`--beads-file full-beads.json --no-live-context` for file-only preparation with
no br, CM or CASS calls. Beads input can be an object or array of full objects;
missing, duplicate, closed, blocked or undecomposed epic tasks prevent publication.
Saved assignments do not attest repository identity: `--repo` is an explicit
operator choice, and saved task data is not proof of current readiness.

The bundle includes `assignments.json`, `packet-NN.json`, `packet-NN.md`, and
`batch.json`. Prompts now include the task description, design and acceptance
criteria, together with the declared write scopes and an instruction not to
expand those scopes silently. Large or truncated task packets block preparation
rather than silently losing acceptance criteria. Ordinary single-packet generation
also includes task briefs and can select a specific ID from a multi-Bead file.

Review every Markdown prompt, then run the returned `preview_command`:

```bash
acfs swarm packet --deliver-batch ./handoff/batch.json
```

That separate preview returns the hash-bound send command. Submission may start
paid model work and project edits. Delivery performs its live herdr agent and
ready-queue checks. See [delivery and recovery](swarm-packet-delivery.md).

## Publication and recovery

The directory must not already exist; its parent must already exist without
symlink components. Preparation validates all tasks and generated packets before
publishing. It creates a mode-0700 directory and mode-0600 files, writing
`batch.json` last. Existing files are not overwritten. An interrupted publication
can leave an incomplete directory; preserve and inspect it rather than deleting
user work. Without a completed manifest, no batch is ready for delivery.

Operation IDs are generated once into the manifest. After sending, keep that
same manifest, packets and receipts for reconciliation. Regenerating a bundle
creates new operations and is **not** a delivery retry.

Declared scope independence is not a reservation. Preparation does not inspect
live Agent Mail reservations, claim Beads, verify account authentication or
establish host capacity. Agents still need to coordinate before editing.

Packet JSON retains source task data and can contain private project information;
it is not a redacted support export. Markdown uses the existing best-effort
context sanitizer, not a guarantee that arbitrary secrets have been removed.
Do not publish handoff directories.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -B tests/unit/test_swarm_packet_preparation.py
```

Tests execute the actual Bash/Python preparation and packet generator, then the
actual batch delivery/reconciliation entrypoint against a herdr socket stub and
br contract fixtures. No installed providers or paid model sessions are exercised.
