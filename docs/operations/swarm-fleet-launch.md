# Execute a reviewed multi-host agent launch

The fleet inventory planner is advisory and describes **target totals**, not
additional processes to start. This controller supplies the missing execution
step for an explicit roster of **new, dedicated native-agent sessions**. It
never converts inventory allocations into launch authority or adds agents to an
existing session. Every host runs its own installed ACFS admission checks.

Run `python3 -I scripts/swarm-fleet-launch.py --help` from a trusted complete
checkout on a Linux controller. This is a checkout command, not a newly installed
`acfs` subcommand. Remotes need the existing native launcher at
`$HOME/.acfs/scripts/lib/swarm_launch.sh`, a running herdr server, Agent Mail
(`am`) and the selected providers.
The project and private receipt parent must already exist on each remote host.
This command does not provision machines, install tools, copy repositories,
authenticate providers, or supply remote credentials.

## Choose exactly what may start

Keep a mode-0600 spec outside version control and support bundles. Each host is
an explicitly authorized direct SSH endpoint. The `request` is the ordinary
single-host launch request; all its fields are mandatory:

```json
{
  "schema": "acfs.swarm-fleet-launch-spec.v1",
  "hosts": [
    {
      "id": "worker-a",
      "host": "worker-a.example.com",
      "user": "ubuntu",
      "port": 22,
      "request": {
        "repo": "/data/projects/myapp",
        "session": "implementation-wave-1",
        "receipt": "/home/ubuntu/receipts/implementation-wave-1.json",
        "profile": "balanced",
        "workload": "standard",
        "accept_warnings": false,
        "agents": [
          {"agent_name": "RedFox", "agent_type": "claude"},
          {"agent_name": "BlueLake", "agent_type": "codex"}
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "worker-b",
      "host": "worker-b.example.com",
      "user": "ubuntu",
      "port": 22,
      "request": {
        "repo": "/data/projects/myapp",
        "session": "review-wave-1",
        "receipt": "/home/ubuntu/receipts/review-wave-1.json",
        "profile": "review-heavy",
        "workload": "standard",
        "accept_warnings": false,
        "agents": [{"agent_name": "GreenHill", "agent_type": "claude"}]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Select 1–16 hosts, 1–32 agents per host, and at most 256 agents in total. Host IDs,
endpoints, and case-insensitive agent names must be distinct. Reusing the same
host with another port/user does not create extra capacity. IPv4-mapped IPv6
aliases are also deduplicated; different DNS aliases can still resolve to the
same machine, which operators must exclude themselves. Root remote accounts,
unknown providers, malformed paths, implicit selections and extra executable
fields are refused. Native support covers Claude, Codex and Antigravity (`agy`).

The workload and profile choose admission policy, **not a provider model or CAAM
account**. Each remote agent CLI's own configuration still chooses its normal
commands, models, permissions and credentials. Use the profile rehearsal
separately to check authentication/model access; this controller does not wire a
CAAM profile into a herdr agent or treat a previous rehearsal as authorization.

## Preview and launch

Choose an existing user-owned, non-group/world-writable parent for local state.
The state directory itself must not yet exist. With the spec saved as
`fleet-launch.json`, preview live admission on all selected hosts:

```bash
python3 -I scripts/swarm-fleet-launch.py \
  --spec fleet-launch.json \
  --known-hosts "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts" \
  --identity-file "$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519" \
  --state-dir "$HOME/fleet-wave-1"
```

The default operation **does open SSH connections**, but only invokes each
native launcher's preview. It creates no controller state and starts no agents;
upstream tools may write their ordinary telemetry. Read the private spec and
per-host admission results, then repeat the same command with:

```bash
  --launch --accept-plan THE_RETURNED_PLAN_SHA256
```

The approval binds the entire roster, remote paths/options, host-key bytes,
explicit SSH identity bytes, local state-directory path, transport policy and
timeout. Changing one requires a new preview. Input filenames may change when
their contents remain the same. The digest is an integrity check for an operator
review, not a signature or remote software attestation.

Launch rechecks **all** hosts before any spawn. A refused/unknown admission or
an already-used remote receipt blocks the whole new operation without creating
local state. After that barrier, hosts launch sequentially in spec order. Each
native launcher performs its own fresh admission immediately before its spawn;
`accept_warnings` cannot override `wait`, `scale_down`, hard failures, or unsafe
agent counts. Admission and spawning are not a fleet-wide atomic reservation.

The controller fsyncs its private fleet intent, then an immutable per-host attempt
record **before** invoking remote launch. The remote native launcher separately
persists its own intent before starting agents. Only a matching ready response
creates a local result record. Its targets (schema `acfs.swarm-launch.v2`) must
be one per slot, in slot order, all in the one herdr workspace labelled for this
launch, with distinct tab, pane, terminal and shell PID, and each with an Agent
Mail name whose lowercase form is its herdr name. Spawn registers those names,
so a ready response must report `agent_mail_registered: true`. Fleet state saved
before the herdr port holds tmux targets and is refused as
`pre_herdr_launch_state_relaunch_required`: launch again under a new receipt.
The controller never executes the command strings returned by remote previews.

## Partial launches are not rolled back or blindly retried

A timeout, lost SSH response, native failure, malformed result or interruption
can leave remote agents running. At the first unconfirmed host, later hosts are
left `not_attempted`. Earlier confirmed sessions and every receipt are retained.
There is no automatic session kill, rollback, replacement, account switch, or
restart. A repeated new launch against an existing controller state directory
is refused before any SSH connection; preserve the state for inspection/recovery.

State is local/private and includes endpoint mappings and repository/receipt
paths. Files are mode 0600 under a mode-0700 directory:

```text
fleet-wave-1/
  intent.json
  worker-a.attempt.json
  worker-a.result.json
  worker-b.attempt.json
  ...
```

A crash while writing can leave incomplete evidence. Malformed state must not be
edited, deleted, or rehashed to retry: inspect it and the remote sessions first.
Do not change remote receipt paths to retry uncertain work. Native receipt-only
inspection remains available on the original host:

```bash
acfs swarm launch --reconcile --receipt /home/ubuntu/receipts/implementation-wave-1.json
```

A ready fleet means native processes were verified, and their Agent Mail names
registered, at each host's check time, not that they are authenticated, executing work, or
still alive when the last host finishes. Use the ordinary launch-aware scoped
packet preparation and reviewed dispatch on each remote; this controller sends
no work prompts, claims no Beads, and acquires no file reservations.

## Reconcile and continue an interrupted fleet

Use the **same spec, trust files, timeout and state directory** as the original
operation. Add `--reconcile` instead of `--launch` to inspect it without starting
anything:

```bash
python3 -I scripts/swarm-fleet-launch.py \
  --spec fleet-launch.json \
  --known-hosts "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts" \
  --identity-file "$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519" \
  --state-dir "$HOME/fleet-wave-1" --reconcile
```

This calls only `acfs swarm launch --reconcile --receipt ...` on hosts with a
recorded local attempt. Untouched hosts are not contacted. An attempted host
**never enters a preview or launch path**, even when its remote intent/result
is missing or an SSH response was lost. Missing evidence is unconfirmed, not
permission to start another session. All known attempts are queried so a failed
host does not hide the status of its already-started peers.

Reconciliation writes no controller files. It returns `ready`/exit 0 only when
all hosts have original verified sessions; an otherwise healthy partial fleet
returns `partial`/exit 1 while leaving untouched hosts marked `not_attempted`.
A changed original pane, terminal, shell or workspace, wrong request, malformed response or
failed query returns `unconfirmed`/exit 1. Manually adopted remote results retain
weaker provenance and are not automatically promoted to original-launch proof;
inspect/manage those sessions separately. No remote recovery/adoption is invoked.

After reviewing the partial result, use `--resume --accept-plan ORIGINAL_DIGEST`
in place of `--reconcile`. Resume requires the original approval, revalidates
all private evidence and queries every attempted host first. If all are
confirmed, it can reconstruct a **missing local result record** from the exact
remote native receipt. Existing local records are never overwritten; observed
targets must match them exactly.

Only then does resume preview **all untouched hosts** again. If every remaining
host is admitted, it starts those hosts sequentially with new durable attempt
records. Another uncertain launch stops continuation, and subsequent resumes
query that newly recorded attempt instead of replaying it. A fully launched
fleet's `--resume` is just reconciliation: it creates no files and starts no
agents. No host is automatically replaced, scaled up, killed, or reassigned.

The controller checks the journal as a coherent prefix of its original host
order. A result without an attempt, an attempted host after an untouched one,
a missing earlier result before a later attempt, extra files, unsafe permissions,
changed plan or truncated JSON stop recovery before SSH. It holds an exclusive
kernel directory lock through reconciliation/continuation and checks the state
path, membership and captured receipt bytes around remote calls. Moving or
replacing a local receipt during a query cannot cause a launch retry. This
protects cooperative operations and detects changes, not a malicious same-user
process modifying both controller and remote evidence. Keep both sets of receipts.

A controller killed after its local attempt but before receiving a remote reply
can recover when the original remote intent **and result** exist and the native
launcher confirms the original live targets. If the remote result was never
published, or the request never reached the remote, the controller remains
unconfirmed rather than guessing. Native inspection and explicitly reviewed
recovery on that host remain separate operations.

## SSH, reporting and verification boundary

Host keys must already be independently verified. Unknown/changed keys fail;
there is no trust-on-first-use prompt or key update. The explicitly selected
identity must be private, owned and single-link. An existing local SSH agent can
unlock its matching key; unrelated identities are excluded and the agent is not
forwarded. SSH configs, proxy/jump/local commands, multiplexing, forwarding, TTYs,
and environment transmission are disabled. Bastions and SSH-config aliases are
not supported. Only directly reachable authorized endpoints are accepted.

Reviewed key/known-host bytes are held in private anonymous snapshots while SSH
runs, not reopened from caller-controlled paths. Children do not inherit shell
or loader hooks or provider credentials. The installed remote account, launcher,
herdr, Agent Mail and provider configuration remain trusted: neither SSH authentication nor
JSON validation attests the remote executable bytes or truth of its claims.
The controller is not an operating-system sandbox.

JSON reports contain logical host IDs, fixed error codes, admission numbers and
validated targets, not raw hostnames, usernames, local/remote paths, key material
or remote diagnostics. Keep the original spec and state private; agent names and
logical IDs in reports should not themselves contain private information.

`--timeout` bounds each SSH operation (default 360 seconds, range 1–600), including
remote admission and launch. stdout/stderr share a 1 MiB in-memory bound. Signals
and deadlines terminate the local SSH process group, not arbitrary remote agents.
A network disconnect cannot prove that remote execution stopped. Starting agents
may consume provider resources; no live launch was used to validate this feature.

Exit 0 means a fully admitted preview or all requested native sessions ready;
1 means blocked admission or unconfirmed/partial launch/reconciliation; 2 means input, approval,
state or local execution error. Signals return 128 plus the signal number.

```bash
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests/unit -p 'test_swarm_fleet_*.py' -v
```

Tests exercise orchestration against the existing native JSON contract, real
private-file publication, no-clobber races, SSH argument/snapshot construction,
actual bounded child processes, abrupt controller SIGKILL/recovery, directory
locking and unprivileged remote-shell argument transport. They do not replace live OpenSSH/VPS/herdr or
authenticated-provider acceptance. The controller never downloads a replacement
launcher or relaxes its policies when a remote installation is missing/stale.
